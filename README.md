# SoroSplit Contract

SoroSplits is a set of smart contracts & interfaces to enable split transactions and revenue sharing across multiple parties in the Stellar ecosystem. 

SoroSplits would allow any assets (tokens) that exist on Stellar to be split in a trustless, automated, & transparent way across addresses and the user interface would enable all Stellar community members & projects to leverage the technology as a public good.
